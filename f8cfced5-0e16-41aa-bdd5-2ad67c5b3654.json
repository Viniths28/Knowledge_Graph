a. Extracted insights and schema mapping:
- Patterns of Use Over Time: Participant reports recently adopting/expanding use of AI tools, especially Tableau and Power BI for analytics and Asana/Trello for project management; use of tools has deepened in response to client demands and project complexity (maps to themes/workflow, new quotes, may slightly increase workflow theme count).
- Jobs and Value Perception: AI adoption allows strategic focus, quick trends identification, efficient collaboration (reiterates goal and workflow, new supporting quote with tool specifics); new quote detailing types of "jobs" filled by AI tools.
- Barriers and Inertia: Cites increased need for advanced visualization as client expectations grow (could reinforce 'pain' and 'workflow' themes, and workflow evolution).
- Emerging Needs & Creative Sparks: Not directly in current transcript; may inform future needs as project scale and collaboration become more complex.

Mapping decisions:
- Meta: Increment interview count if this was a new interview; as same participant, no meta update required.
- Participants, topRoles, topIndustries: No change; same participant.
- Themes: "Evolving data analytics workflow," may increment 'workflow' theme count/prevalence. Specific mention of Asana/Trello for real-time collaboration; evidence for team dynamic sub-theme.
- LearningGoals: Supporting evidence for how AI is adopted and which tools "stick" (coverage remains).
- Signals: Further evidence for efficiency gain and workflow shift (may add supporting quote to existing signal).
- Insights: New named tools expand context for prior findings; quote ids can be added for relevant findings.
- Quotes: New attributed quotes for use of Tableau, Power BI, Asana, Trello, and for real client-driven evolution.
- Interviews: Append new transcript turns to current interview.

b. Mapping explanations:
- Themes: Reinforces and expands "workflow" and "goal" themes with mention of specific platforms; increment count/prevalence as needed.
- Signals: New evidence for existing signals about efficiency and workflow value; add new quoteIds.
- Insights: Add more quotes where relevant to findings about impact, barriers, and balance of tools/human.
- Quotes: Attribute all new user responses as new Quote entries with unique quoteIds, proper timestamps.
- Interviews: Add transcript turns for this new segment, preserving strict order and structure.
