// Insights mapped from the transcript to the schema:
// 
// a. Extracted Insights and Mapping
// - Peter is a heavy user of generative AI in his role at IPS, leveraging multiple tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Bolt, Copilot) for a range of professional tasks (research, document/image production, product support, prototyping, IT setup). Maps to Participant (role, industry, seniority), Interview (transcript and insights), Theme (workflow, goal).
// - He creates and shares custom GPTs, notably a "Community Recovery Committee Navigator" tool, for efficient info management and team enablement. Maps to Themes, LearningGoal, Signal, Quote, Insight.
// - Example use case: enabled efficient info sharing for a community, avoiding unnecessary meetings and time spent searching documents. Maps to Insight, Quote.
// - Confidence is high, but he follows a personal "always be validating" (ABV) principle, especially for critical tasks (calculations, citations). Prefers manual validation in some scenarios. Maps to Theme (barrier), Insight, Quote.
// - He has directly caught AI errors (e.g., Gemini's incorrect superannuation calculation), demonstrating active management of AI limitations. Maps to Signal, Quote, Insight.
// - Expressed desire for enablement/resources in developing more sophisticated AI tools (AI guidelines, opportunity assessment, proposal assistant, virtual consultant, presentation designer), with a virtual consultant for production/logistics as biggest impact. Maps to Theme (goal, motivation), LearningGoal, Insight, Quote.
// - Wants practical examples and enablement specific to consulting and client-facing workflows. Maps to LearningGoal, Theme.
// - Sentiment throughout is engaged and generally positive, occasional caution; sentiment values kept neutral/positive for schema compatibility.
// 
// b. Mapping Explanation (per field)
// - meta: Set counts = 1, token usage and durations estimated from transcript length, as it’s first/only participant/interview.

// - topRoles/topIndustries: Inferred as "Consultant" and "Consulting/Professional Services" given use cases described.
// - themes: 
//    - workflows: heavy integration of generative AI 
//    - goals: efficiency, building custom AI solutions
//    - barriers: need for validation/trust, manual checks on AI output
