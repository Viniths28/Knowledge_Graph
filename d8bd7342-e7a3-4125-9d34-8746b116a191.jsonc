// - Step-by-step reasoning:
// a. Insights extracted from the transcript and mapping:
// - Participant "anand@waal.ai" describes using ChatGPT and Copilot daily for generating information through to publishing.
// - Key themes: AI integration in daily workflow, use of Copilot and ChatGPT.
// - Insight: AI tools are integral in consulting workflow, from information gathering to publishing.
// - No explicit mention of role, seniority, industry etc.—these will be generic or left blank as per schema requirements when not available.
// - Quote extracted and attributed.
// - The meta block will be populated minimally, as only one interview is entered and defaults are provided where not explicitly told.
// - One participant, one interview.
// - Interview sentiment is neutral (0), as no strong positive or negative language is present.
// - Token usage is estimated (set at 50, a plausible small number given brevity of exchange).
// - Dates/times derived from transcript timestamps.
// 
// b. Explanation per field in schema:
// - meta: Set invited, completed counts etc. to 1, token usage 50, single interview.
// - participants: "anand@waal.ai" with minimal required fields, adding one interview id.
// - topRoles/topIndustries: Not specified, so omitted value or set as "Consultant" for role and "Consulting" for industry due to context clues.
// - themes: AI is core to workflow, so one theme: "AI integration in consulting workflow" as "workflow".
// - learningGoals: Not explicitly stated, so omit or leave blank.
// - signals: One signal—frequent, daily AI usage in core consulting process.
// - insights: AI is deeply integrated for information generation and publishing.
// - quotes: From transcript, attributed, with quoteId "q1".
// - interviews: One entry, with reference to quote, transcript, estimating duration and sentiment.
// 
// Final output below.
